## Introduction


### Let's try to define our goal: What is AGI?

### The Extraordinary Economic Impact of even a "Dumb" AGI

### There likely won't be a "singularity"

#### The Elefant in the Room: "Moore's Law"

#### The Human Brain Runs on 20 Watts, Transistors-based AGI won't

- Will AGI be able to develop and manufacture something better than transistors on its own?

#### Energetic Upper Bound to Self Improvement and Replication

#### Are We Suddenly Avandoning the Scientific Method?

- You can not infinitely self improve without new fundamental knowledge of the physical world
- You can not aquire new fundamental knowledge of the physical world without experiments
- You can not perform experiments at a rate faster than the physical processes you are trying to understand
