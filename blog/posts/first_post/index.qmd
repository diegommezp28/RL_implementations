## A Brief Introduction

For a while now i have been trying to express my thoughs in a shareable media. I ran around circles trying to figure out which technology should i use, with what topic should i start and many other self-made blockers. Finally, i think i've found a decent media that has all the requirements i hoped for. This blog and the website itself is powered by [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), a technology that lets me combine Markdown, Python, R, and Latex into a single document

This is a note to myself: *You are now out of excuses to actually start writing*

A personal Blog is a project i've been procrastinating for a while now. The idea of exposing you thoughts for everyone to see them is rather scary, but i can not think of a better way of actually learning an consolidating ones mental models. Language is a projection of our thoughts, and writing is a way of making them tangible, and most importantly, shareable.




## Quarto's Capabilities
What follows now is dummy made up content to demonstrate the capabilities of Quarto.

### A Nice Figure

Tet's see if we can add a nice figure to this post.

```{python}
#| label: fig-polar
#| fig-cap: "A line plot on a polar axis"

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(
  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} 
)
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

### A Pretty Equation

Now let's do some math.

$$
\int_0^\infty x^2 dx
$$

::: {.callout-tip}
## Tip

Use single dollar sings \$ for inline math $\frac{1}{2}$
:::

::: {.column-margin}
**Some column margin text in here: **

We know from *the first fundamental theorem of calculus* that for $x$ in $[a, b]$:

$$\frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{a}^{x} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x).$$
:::

### An Interactive Plot

What if we want the nice graph to be interactive?

```{python}
#| label: fig-interactive
#| fig-cap: "An interactive plot"
#| code-fold: false
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.io as pio
df = px.data.iris()
fig = px.scatter(df, x="sepal_width", y="sepal_length",             # <1>
                 color="species",                                  # <1>
                 marginal_y="violin", marginal_x="box",            # <1>
                 trendline="ols", template="simple_white")         # <1>
fig.show()
```

### Pretty Tables

| Default | Left | Right | Center |
|---------|:-----|------:|:------:|
| 12      | 12   |    12 |   12   |
| 123     | 123  |   123 |  123   |
| 1       | 1    |     1 |   1    |

### A Wider Figure

```{python}
#| label: fig-wide
#| fig-cap: "A wide figure"
#| column: page
#| code-fold: false


import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/earthquakes-23k.csv')

import plotly.express as px
fig = px.density_mapbox(df, lat='Latitude', lon='Longitude', z='Magnitude', radius=10,
                        center=dict(lat=0, lon=180), zoom=0,
                        mapbox_style="open-street-map")
fig.show()
```

::: {.column-margin}
| Default | Left | Right | Center |
|---------|:-----|------:|:------:|
| 12      | 12   |    12 |   12   |
| 123     | 123  |   123 |  123   |
| 1       | 1    |     1 |   1    |

### Citations and Cross-References
What about some biblioghraphy and cross-references?

- Reinforcement Learning Stuff [@montague1999reinforcement]
- Cross-referencing a figure @fig-interactive

It support BibTeX and Cross-references. cool!!
